# Untitled-GOHTAVSAR-Project

Just added the 'Player.java', 'Weapon.java', and 'Controller.java' classes in the java/classes directory.
I also created a main class/file in the java directory.
I think I successfully created the 'gohtafsar' package, and I think I successfully called it in main.java, it just doesn't work.
Young man is getting a bit spiced on the whole ordeal tbh.
